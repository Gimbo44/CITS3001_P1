Constantly trying to give "2,2,2" as a valid AI answer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter your move in the format: level row column 1 4 1
AI placed a piece at level 1 row 3 column 4
Level 1:
1 1 2 1
1 2 1 2
2 2 0 2
1 0 1 1
Level 2:
2 1 2
2 0 0
0 0 0
Level 3:
0 0
0 0
Level 4:
0

You have 6 pieces remaining and the ai has 6 pieces remaining

Enter your move in the format: level row column 1 4 2
You may remove 1 or 2 of your pieces
Enter the first piece you want to remove in the format: level row column 1 4 1
Enter the second piece you want to remove in the format (leave blank to remove no piece): level row column 1 4 2
AI placed a piece at level 1 row 3 column 3

The actual board would've been:

Level 1:
1 1 2 1
1 2 1 2
2 2 2 2
1 0 1 1
Level 2:
2 1 2
2 0 0
0 0 0
Level 3:
0 0
0 0
Level 4:
0

SOLUTION! Found it might be triggered when asked if it wants to remove more than one... Huh

Might be good to keep track of all pieces placed and places available.. 
	would be messy but would cut down on run-time.


Getting stuck at line 95-97
Gets stuck because it keeps trying to remove an optimal piece... which hasn't been set.


Level 1:
2 2 1 2
1 1 2 2
1 2 2 2
1 1 2 1
Level 2:
2 1 1
1 2 1
2 2 0
Level 3:
1 2
1 0
Level 4:
0


Potential bug??

level 2, both players are attempting to place at level 2 3,3 and being prompted to move a piece..
